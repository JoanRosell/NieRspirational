I did my best.
I saw this through to the end.
It was hard for me as well.
I've had my share of hardship.
I've walked the same road as you.
You and I are the same.
We're not that different, you and I.
I won't give up!
It'd be amazing if you cleared this alone.
I'm serious, even if it's just a game!
I love this game!
I'm confident in my shooting abilities.
I'm not a strong shooter.
Shooters are tough.
The bullets rain down without pause.
I bet you're having a tough time right now.
I thought it was some kind of mistake.
I thought it would never end.
Sometimes you just feel trapped.
You'd love to go home already, wouldn't you?
Your eyes get tired, don't they?
You did your best.
You're holding up well.
You are one who knows fear.
I may not have the right to say this.
Tomorrow is my day off.
Wait, tomorrow's MONDAY!?
There's always next time!
If you give up, you're done for.
The struggle must continue.
Your shoulders are tense. Relaaaaax.
Some wars never end.
Step up as many times as it takes!
Do not avert your eyes from difficulties.
Good results must be earned.
You were so close to winning that last fight.
It's sad, but things don't always work out.
2B and 9S put their lives on the line.
Limits exist to be broken!
I'm not done yet!
Cut your way through!
Throw yourself into a battle with no end.
Push yourself beyond your limits.
Your growth hinges on your resolve.
You must decide what it means to exist.
Sometimes you forget what it means to live.
You can't fight on an empty stomach.
My voice may not reach you.
Are you really giving up here?
Any juice left in your batteries?
Do you like this game?
Can you see the light of hope?
I'm sure *you* can handle this.
That all you've got?
Are you tired?
You must be exhausted.
Haven't you just about had enough?
I know what you want to say.
Let's calm down for a moment.
How many continues is this?
Have you realized how weak you are?
You were zoning out there!
There's no trick to this.
What are you doing?
Having fun?
What if you get cornered?
Not everyone in this world plays fair.
This world is ride with hardship.
This is an unwinnable fight.
What you're playing now is a mere game.
It's just a game in the end, right?
You're thinking this is impossible, right?
Shitty world, shitty game!
Lose, lose, and lose some more!
I've always heard games are "just for fun."
Does this battle have meaning?
The real world is naught but hardship.
You're surrounded by enemies.
Do you care for this worthless world?
Is there an answer at the end of this battle?
You are alone.
Is this the fight you wanted?
Do you think help is on the way?
Are you at your wit's end?
Feel like running away?
Who are you?
Help isn't coming.
How long do you plan to continue?
You'll die many times before it's over.
You're weak!
There is nothing but despair.
Haven't given up yet?
You're tough.
Are you alone?
The fight was everything.
Can you really keep going?
Oh, come on! No one told me about this!
Love and hate are two sides of the same coin.
Who needs sleep anyway?
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
I like 2B!
I like 9S!
I like A2!
I like Emil!
I'm a Popola fan!
I'm a Devola fan!
Negative.

One thing is certain:
In any case,
On the other hand,
In other words,
Actually,
Don't make excuses;
On top of that,
Instead,
In the end,
On the contrary,
Specifically,
But,
But
But...
If not,
Otherwise,
If not, then
What's more,
However,
Moreover,
If so,
Therefore,
Well,
Or, rather,
Namely,
At least
Then, after that,
Doing so,
If you don't,
Not really, but...
If that's the case,
If that's not so, then
Er, I mean,
Otherwise,
Wait, no, I mean
That being said,
That reminds me,
So, then,
Then
And, also,
As an alternative
For that purpose,
As a result,
After that,
And also,
In that case,
So,
Despite that,
Because of that,
All the same,
At the same time,
Even so,
And thus we can say,
In addition,
And yet,
Nevertheless,
In addition to that,
Not only that,
But that's not all;
That aside,
Putting that aside,
Because of this, 
The feeling is:
As such,
So
While it may be so,
Or
But even so,
But still,
Still,
In which case,
I mean,
If that's true,
Given that,
In spite of that,
That said,
To give an example
By the way,
Incidentally,
What I mean is...
Though,
And thus,
Nonetheless,
What I mean to say is,
If that weren't the case,
Now then,
But, even so,
Or should I say,
Or rather,
Yet, 
Anyway,
Either way,
At any rate,
Having said that,
Be that as it may,
In particular,
With that in mind,
And yet, still,
Why? Because
Despite this,
If that's the truth,
Notwithstanding,
Conversely,
Which leads us to:
And remember,
Also,
Or, you could play
Rather,
Just remember,
Thus,
Basically,

I feel the same.
I've got my eyes on you.

I feel a finger cramp coming on.
I'm starving.

you're worthless.

this game is crap anyway.
I hate PlatinumGames!
just stop playing if you're that bad.
even in video games, you're useless.
it's time to return to the real world.

I've given up.
