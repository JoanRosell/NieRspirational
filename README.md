## General info
This is a project idea from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Path. I built this project in order to practice vanilla JavaScript syntax and to learn to work with npm. The message options have been extracted from the game NieR: Automata and saved to a text file.
## Technologies
* JavaScript ES6
* Node.js v14.15.4
## Setup
```
$ git clone git@github.com:JoanRosell/NieRspirational.git
$ cd ./NieRspirational
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
## Status
This project is finished but I plan to improve it, see [Future work](#future-work).

## Future work
In the future I want to turn this little app into a twitter bot to post the messages it generates. In addition to that, the message generation logic will be improved in order to make better messages (as of now, there are some weird option combinations that don't make much sense).
